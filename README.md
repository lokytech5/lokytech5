### 🌟 Greetings! I'm [lokosman] - Backend Engineer & Tech Enthusiast.

🔍 Deep down, I'm more than just a backend engineer; I'm a craftsman of code, orchestrating the unseen gears that power digital solutions. I'm someone who truly loves and feels invigorated by the vast world of technology. Web development isn't just a task for me; it's a journey where I continuously discover and engage with new tools and techniques. The spark I feel isn't just about building; it's about understanding deeply and then breaking things down to their simplest forms. Sharing what I learn isn't just a habit; it's a joy, a way of giving back. Each piece I write is a little part of me, hoping to light a path or spark a eureka moment for someone else.
